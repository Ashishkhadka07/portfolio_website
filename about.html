            <h3>Junior <span>Frontend</span> Developer</h3>
            <p>Hi! I'm Ashish Khadka, an enthusiastic and creative web developer with a passion for developing websites
                with cleanb code and responsive designs. I specialize in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I'm currently
                expanding my skills by learning React.js. I love turning ideas into digital reality, whether it's a
                simple static website or a dynamic and interactive platform.
                <br><br>
                As a web developer, I focus on:
                <br>
            <ul>
                <li>Clean, maintainable code</li>
                <li>Responsive design for all devices</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                I’m currently pursuing my bachelor's degree in IT and have been working on various projects that enhance
                my development skills. From personal projects to academic assignments, each one has taught me something
                new about the ever-evolving field of web development.
                <br><br>
                In my free time, I enjoy experimenting with new technologies, learning more about full-stack
                development, and contributing to open-source projects. I am excited about the future of web development
                and am eager to work on more complex and impactful projects.
